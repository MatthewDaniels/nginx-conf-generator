# Nginx conf generator

A little opinionated nginx conf generator - I was sick of copying existing conf files and editing in vim, so thought I would generate a little html conf generator.

There are is a lot of conf that exists beyond these little conf files, so this is really only part of the picture, but it serves a need.

------

Really this is just for personal use, but if you get value out of using it, feel free :)


**Disclaimer:** The code is not the best - very functional and a bit of mix between pure js and jquery (probably could have done without jquery tbh). 

I will at some stage improve it over time, here is a list of things to do:

- [ ] Reduce js & css dependencies
- [ ] Add a build script for template inclusions, minification etc
- [ ] Add some more conf options and capabilities
- [ ] Ability to download folder/s of conf setup
- [ ] Add extra conf files (the other config for my code)
- [ ] Add Docker run script generators
- [ ] Improve UI


*Also:* If you use this, there is no liability that it will serve you well - make sure you understand what you are doing before using this for your own needs.
