# Nginx conf generator

A little opinionated nginx conf generator - I was sick of copying existing conf files and editing in vim, so thought I would generate a little html conf generator.

There are is a lot of conf that exists beyond these little conf files, so this is really only part of the picture, but it serves a need.

Really this is just for personal use, but if you get value out of using, feel free :)


*Disclaimer:* The code is not the best - very functional and a bit of mix between pure js and jquery (probably could have done without jquery tbh)


*Also:* If you use this, there is no liability that it will serve you well - make sure you understand what you are doing before using this for your own needs.
